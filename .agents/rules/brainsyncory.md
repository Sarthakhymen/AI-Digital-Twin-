## Safety — Never Run Destructive Commands

> Dangerous commands are actively monitored.
> Critical/high risk commands trigger error notifications in real-time.

- **NEVER** run `rm -rf`, `del /s`, `rmdir`, `format`, or any command that deletes files/directories without EXPLICIT user approval.
- **NEVER** run `DROP TABLE`, `DELETE FROM`, `TRUNCATE`, or any destructive database operation.
- **NEVER** run `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, or any command that rewrites history.
- **NEVER** run `npm publish`, `docker rm`, `terraform destroy`, or any irreversible deployment/infrastructure command.
- **NEVER** pipe remote scripts to shell (`curl | bash`, `wget | sh`).
- **ALWAYS** ask the user before running commands that modify system state, install packages, or make network requests.
- When in doubt, **show the command first** and wait for approval.

**Stack:** JavaScript/Python · FastAPI + React + Tailwind · DB: PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLAlchemy

## Project Standards

- convention in .gitignore
- Git Commit: fix: Remove unused signIn variable from GoogleSignIn compone — confirmed 3x
- Git Commit: Enhanced Home page with animations, GIF demos, and video mod — confirmed 3x
- Version your API from day 1 (/api/v1/)
- Use consistent response format across all endpoints
- Implement soft delete for important data — don't hard delete without confirmation
- Handle timezone correctly — store UTC, display in user's timezone
- Make layouts responsive from the start — mobile-first approach

## Verified Best Practices

- Agent generates new migration for every change (squash related changes)
- Agent installs packages without checking if already installed

### 📚 Core Framework Rules: [callstackincubator/react-native-best-practices]
# React Native Best Practices

## Overview

Performance optimization guide for React Native applications, covering JavaScript/React, Native (iOS/Android), and bundling optimizations. Based on Callstack's "Ultimate Guide to React Native Optimization".

## Skill Format

Each reference file follows a hybrid format for fast lookup and deep understanding:

- **Quick Pattern**: Incorrect/Correct code snippets for immediate pattern matching
- **Quick Command**: Shell commands for process/measurement skills
- **Quick Config**: Configuration snippets for setup-focused skills
- **Quick Reference**: Summary tables for conceptual skills
- **Deep Dive**: Full context with When to Use, Prerequisites, Step-by-Step, Common Pitfalls

**Impact ratings**: CRITICAL (fix immediately), HIGH (significant improvement), MEDIUM (worthwhile optimization)

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Debugging slow/janky UI or animations
- Investigating memory leaks (JS or native)
- Optimizing app startup time (TTI)
- Reducing bundle or app size
- Writing native modules (Turbo Modules)
- Profiling React Native performance
- Reviewing React Native code for performance

### 📚 Core Framework Rules: [callstackincubator/upgrading-react-native]
# Upgrading React Native

## Overview

Covers the full React Native upgrade workflow: template diffs via Upgrade Helper, dependency updates, Expo SDK steps, and common pitfalls.

## Typical Upgrade Sequence

1. **Route**: Choose the right upgrade path via [upgrading-react-native.md][upgrading-react-native]
2. **Diff**: Fetch the canonical template diff using Upgrade Helper via [upgrade-helper-core.md][upgrade-helper-core]
3. **Dependencies**: Assess and update third-party packages via [upgrading-dependencies.md][upgrading-dependencies]
4. **React**: Align React version if upgraded via [react.md][react]
5. **Expo** (if applicable): Apply Expo SDK layer via [expo-sdk-upgrade.md][expo-sdk-upgrade]
6. **Verify**: Run post-upgrade checks via [upgrade-verification.md][upgrade-verification]



## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Moving a React Native app to a newer version
- Reconciling native config changes from Upgrade Helper
- Validating release notes for breaking changes
